These are my working copies of the IC-705 to XPA 125B remote bluetooth bandswitch
interface using an Adruino Uno.  I was never able to get the last two digits of the
frequency to read accurately on the Arduino serial monitor but
it has no affect since those are disregarded in the sketch anyway. 
Feel free to modify as you wish.  Any comments would be appreciated.
