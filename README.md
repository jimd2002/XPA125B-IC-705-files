These are my working copies of the IC-705 to XPA 125B remote Bluetooth band switch
interface using an Adruino Uno.

Please be aware I take no responsibility for any damage to equipment.  If 
you are not an experienced kit builder I would caution against attempting this 
project.  The 6 pin din plug can be particularly tricky to get correct.

I was never able to get the last two digits of the
frequency to read accurately on the Arduino serial monitor probably due to a line carry 
or something but I did not take the time to troubleshoot this as
it has no affect since those are disregarded in the sketch anyway. 

Please use extra caution with wiring and do not overload the IC-705 key low line.
Feel free to modify as you wish.  Any comments would be appreciated.
